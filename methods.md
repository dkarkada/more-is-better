# RF experiments

We validate the RF eigenframework by experimentally probing two random feature models:
* High-dimensional linear regression with synthetic data generated with powerlaw structure.  predictor on synthetic data (Gaussian inputs with labels generated by a powerlaw $\hat y = Wx$ 
* Kernel regression with the NNGP kernel of the neural network $f(x)=W_2^T\cdot\mathrm{ReLU}(W_1 x)$ learning CIFAR10. This learning task was studied in (preetums paper). 

We emphasize that powerlaw structure is not a requirement for applying our RF eigenframework; we chose experiments with powerlaw structure because natural data have this structure.
